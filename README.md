## Introduction

This is a OPA policy library for Terraform and IBM Cloud Provider.  It is designed to be a helper for your own OPA Policy repository.  This rego library provides a simple abstractions to read the policy-information generated by Terraform and support IaC tools.  For example, read hcl file, plan json file, state file, etc., in a common and consistent manner.  It also include a set of generic and customizable rego rules for IBM Cloud resources, provisioned using `Terraform Provider for IBM Cloud`. It can be used with a tool that evaluates Terraform infrastructure-as-code for potential IBMCloud misconfigurations and compliance violations prior to deployment.

## Framework structure

The directory structure for the fame work is as shown below.

```

```

- lib directory has rego functions for terraform plan and generic rules.
- resources directory has the rules-evaluation logic for individual ibmcloud resource.


## Evaluating terraform-plan locally

Install the prerequisites:

- [OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#1-download-opa)
- [Terraform 0.12+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
- Install Python 3
- Install pip for Python 3 
- Install jinja2 : `pip3 install jinja2`

## How does terraform-opa-ibm work?

terraform-opa-ibm provides a rego based function to read the IBM Cloud 'resource' information, provisioned using `Terraform Provider for IBM Cloud`. The functions available to read:

* Resource information from Terraform plan file.
* Resource information from Terraform state file.

##  How to use terraform-opa-ibm in the users policy repo:

### Run the following command:

`git-vendor https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-opa-ibm.git`

use the the directory where `terraform-opa-ibm` is vendored and Rego code defined while evaluating the policy. 

Some example:

```opa eval --format pretty  -d <path_to_terraform-opa-ibm> -d <path-to-plan-json-file> "data.terraform.analysis.ibm.cos"```
