## Introduction

This is a Rego based policy library, the policy language used by the Open Policy Agent (OPA), for the `IBM Cloud Provider plugin for Terraform`.  It is designed to be a helper, for your own OPA Policy repository.  This Rego library provides a simple abstractions to read the policy-information generated by Terraform, in a common and consistent manner.  For example, the terraform generated `plan json` file and the `state` file.  It also include a set of generic and customizable Rego rules for IBM Cloud resources, provisioned using `IBM Cloud Provider plugin for Terraform`. It can be used in your DevOps pipelines, to assess for potential mis-configurations or compliance violations in IBM Cloud, prior to the infrastructure deployment.  Use this library to develop the following types of IT Controls policies:

- Naming & tagging policy
- Configuration threshold policy
- Resource sizing policy
- IAM Security policy
- Network Security policy
- Data Security policy
- Change management policy
- and more..

## Framework structure

The directory structure for the framework is as shown below.

```

```

- lib directory has Rego functions for terraform plan and generic rules.
- resources directory has the rules-evaluation logic for individual ibmcloud resource.


## Evaluating terraform-plan locally

Install the prerequisites:

- [Open Policy Agent](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/#1-download-opa)
- [Terraform 0.12+](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

## How does terraform-opa-ibm work?

terraform-opa-ibm provides a Rego based function to read the IBM Cloud 'resource' information, provisioned using `IBM Cloud Provider plugin for Terraform`. The functions available to read:

* Resource information from Terraform plan file.
* Resource information from Terraform state file.

##  How to use terraform-opa-ibm in the users policy repo:

### Run the following command:

`git-vendor https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-opa-ibm.git`

Use the the directory where `terraform-opa-ibm` is vendored and Rego code defined while evaluating the policy. 

Some example:

* To check Terraform plan file against `terraform-op-ibm` based rules:
   
  ```opa eval --format pretty  -d <path_to_terraform-opa-ibm based rule> -d <path-to-plan-json-file> "data.terraform.analysis.ibm.cos"```
   
* To check Terraform state file against `terraform-op-ibm` based rules:
   
  ```opa eval --format pretty  -d <path_to_terraform-opa-ibm based rule> -d <path-to-state-json-file> "data.terraform.analysis.ibm.cos"```
